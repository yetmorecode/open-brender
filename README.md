# OpenBRender

BRender clone for DOS

## Motivation

It's 2022 and I've been poking around BRender for about 5 years. It's too young to die. Let's bring it back!

I found those great minds at https://github.com/dethrace-labs/dethrace/tree/main/src/BRSRC13 providing a IDA based decompilation as well.
