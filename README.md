# OpenBRender

BRender clone for DOS

## Motivation

It's 2022 and I've been poking around BRender for about 5 years. It's too young to die. Let's bring it back!

I found those great minds at https://github.com/dethrace-labs/dethrace/tree/main/src/BRSRC13 providing a IDA based decompilation as well.

What is BRender?

BRender is a rendering engine, the `bit of magic in the middle' that turns a scene into an image. 
It is the TV camera of virtual reality, translating an abstract description of a set, 
with its actors, cameras and lights, into a picture on a screen.

BRender is a combination of the most recent research in 3D graphics techniques and algorithms, 
and painstaking efforts to translate those algorithms into streamlined, lean, mean and 
highly optimised C code. Efficiency notwithstanding, BRender has always been designed 
with cross-platform portability, a wide range of useful features, and 
general purpose application, firmly in mind.
